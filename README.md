# PHP Frameworks Bench
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/myaaghubi/PHP-Frameworks-Bench?color=purpol) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/myaaghubi/PHP-Frameworks-Bench?color=green)

This project attempts to measure the minimum overhead (minimum bootstrap cost) of PHP frameworks in the real world.

So I think the minimum should not include:

* cost of template engine
* cost of database manipulation
* cost of debugging information

Benchmarking on components like template engines or ORM/Database libraries is out of the scope of this project.

## Benchmarking Policy

This is for the `main` branch.

* Frameworks installed via `composer` according to their official documentation.
* Used the default configuration.
  * Considering the minimum changes on frameworks to run the benchmark.
  * Didn't remove any components/configurations even if there is no use for them.
* We have a `controller` class to get the `Hello World` for each, based on the default template of each framework.
* Turned off the `debug` mode and set the environment to `production` mode.
* Considered general optimization for the production environment, like `--optimize-autoloader` for the composer.

Some frameworks are optimized more than others, so some people may think using default configuration is not fair. The dept of optimizing a framework depends on the experiences of the developer too, so it's the rabbit hole and there is no point in it. I think the default configuration of frameworks is a good starting point to get ranking.

If you find something wrong in my code, feel free to send a PR. But please note optimizing for the "Hello World" is not acceptable! Building the fastest `Hello World` application is not the goal of this project.


## How to Benchmark

If you want to have benchmarks on `PHP extension frameworks` like Phalcon, you need to install the extension first based on its own documentation.

1- Download & Setup:

```bash
# ...--branch vx.x
$ git clone https://github.com/myaaghubi/PHP-Frameworks-Bench.git

$ cd PHP-Frameworks-Bench

# run the setup & follow the progress
# check out benchmark.config
# yes | bash setup.sh
$ bash setup.sh
```

2- Make sure everything is ok:

```bash
# this is optional
$ bash check.sh
# bash check.sh -t pure-php
# /------- pure-php: checking... done.
```

3- Run benchmarks:

```bash
$ bash benchmark.sh
```

4- Check the resuts:
- web:

  <http://localhost/PHP-Frameworks-Bench/>

- command:
  ```
  bash show-table.sh
  ```


## Commands

```bash
# run composer update for frameworks
$ bash update.sh

# to clean them all
# trouble? run it then
# you can use `bash setup.sh` again
$ bash clean.sh

# clear the cache of frameworks
$ bash clear-cache.sh

# show the results of the last benchmark
$ bash show-table.sh
```

To specify the frameworks, put them with `-t ...` after each command:

```bash
# supported for `setup.sh`, `benchmark.sh`, `update.sh`, `clean.sh`, and `clear-cache.sh`
# bash benchmarks.sh --help -h
$ bash benchmark.sh -t laravel-10.0/ slim-4.11/ ...
...
```
